#TODO: implement the whole map
#TODO: introduction of "states" in entity class
# the states define how the update will function, how the render will function
# for instance, if the state is "attacking", there'll be a certain animation, the input will be handled in a certain way etc
#TODO: implement the "block" tiles classes (so that they are not fully blocking the tile)
#TODO: add mobs and get them AI driven
#TODO: inventory
#TODO: add problems

#FIX: rendering by layers

# Maybe we could separate collision hitboxes and action hitboxes by making sub-classes
# As collision hitboxes' commands are not meant to ever be triggered
#     and action hitboxes gets no benefits in also being a collision one
# that would lighten the code from it's many generated hitboxes that all have a empty command
#
# Idk i was just thinking smth like that
