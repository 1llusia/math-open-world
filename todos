#TODO: implement the "block" tiles classes (so that they are not fully blocking the tile)
#TODO: implement the whole map
#TODO: add mobs and "AI" for them

#FIX: rendering by layers

# Maybe we could separate collision hitboxes and action hitboxes by making sub-classes
# As collision hitboxes' commands are not meant to ever be triggered
#     and action hitboxes gets no benefits in also being a collision one
# that would lighten the code from it's many generated hitboxes that all have a empty command
#
# Idk i was just thinking smth like that
